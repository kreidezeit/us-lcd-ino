# us-lcd-ino
Ultrasonic sensor with an arduino and a I2C display 

for Arduino uno

All started with an idea to make it simple, just like the picture of the open-roberta block-code
after trying I decided to realise it in the arduino ide, but in the end it's a mesh up of an easy lcd code and the open-roberta generated code
